                          3 rotations include:
                          <li>Developed an integration between Amazon Alexa and Itron meters through a Raspberry Pi using Python and C as the programming languages and Zigbee and Bluetooth as the wireless protocols.</li>
                          <li>Managed all cloud devices and delegated on-site engineers to fix connectivity issues on pilot program to place ~120 Zigbee routers in homes to transmit data to cloud</li>
                          <li>Put in charge of designing and prototyping hardware to allow ConEd NY to comply with new grid safety and National Electric Code protocols; created a technical document on

                        <p> I have been a part of <a href="http://clemsonparalympicsoccer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Clemson Paralympic Soccer </a> for most of my
                        time at Clemson, where the focus is on both introducing injured military veterans to adaptive sports as well as working directly with the US Paralympic Soccer Team.<br></br>
                        With the veterans, we are on our 5th year of a grant that provides us the ability to host 3-4 day camps throughout the year all over the nation that will bring in the veterans together.
                        In the camps, we have introduced adaptive sport to the veterans, gave them their grassroots soccer coaching license, and as of this year, mental health first aid certified as well.
                        I have participated myself in over 5 camps now helping out with the veterans as well as doing research throughout the camp to collect data surrounding best practices, program evaluation and impact to further improve the program's efforts. <br></br>I have also now received a Blaze Sports Adaptive Recreation and Sports Specialist as well as a Mental Health First Aid certification.  <br></br>
                        Another aspect of our program is directly help develop the US Paralympic Soccer Team in preparation for the 2028 Paralympic Games in Los Angeles.
                        We are working to start a paralympic soccer team here at Clemson, one of the first teams for a university.  We also work with the head coach of the US team to scout players throughout
                        the country that could be potential candidates for both the Clemson team as well as the US team.<br></br>

                        <p>I have been a soccer referee since I was 13 years old. Since I played soccer at the time, it made sense to me to get into refereeing as well to be part of a different aspect of the game.
                          Throughout my time as a referee, I have been in charge of player safety, enforcing the Laws of the Game, travelling across the country, as well as maintain my physical fitness to keep up with the
                          ever increasing speed of play.  I've learned many life skills from being a referee from a young age such as person management, teamwork between my referee crew, as well as confidence from having to
                          stick with my decision with at least the other team and parents disagreeing with me. </p>
