                        <p>I was presented an opportunity to switch to a Site Reliability Engineering team and I jumped on it. I started off working on automation and templates that could be used within the

                          <li>Currently developing Python script to allow for automatic code deployments to reduce deployment time by ~1hr each deployment.</li>
                          <li>Developed Python script and Terraform code to template monitoring services based on industry recommendations for all application teams to use.</li>

                        <h2>Ally Financial - Bank Production Engineer<span>Jan 2022 - Jun 2022</span></h2>
                        <p>I started at Ally Financial as a production engineer in their Early Talent Program. We started off the program with a bootcamp 
                          where we had a capstone project. In that capstone, my team and I built a project management system hosted in AWS using Terraform. In the project, I:
                          <li>worked on most of the backend and Terraform</li>
                          <li>created a system design using DynamoDB, Cognito, S3, CloudFront, Lambda, and API Gateway</li>
                          <li>debugged and fixed HTTPS headers to eliminate CORS errors</li>
                          <br></br>
                          Now that I am on my actual team, I have been focused on different projects relating to automation, monitoring, VOC reporting, and IAM provisioning.
                          <br></br>
                          <br></br>
                          For automation, I created an automated health check script for the databases that the deposit teams use. This is an Ansible script that will check different properties of the 
                          Oracle DBs such as TablespaceUsage and InvalidIndex.
                          <br></br>
                          <br></br>
                          For monitoring, I have worked in Datadog and Splunk to create monitors and alerts for our production instances that have moved to AWS. These alerts and monitors have been used to 
                          help triage different incidents.
                          <br></br>
                          <br></br>
                          We have a tool to collect VOCs (Voice of Customers). I inherited this code from a peer who left the company and needed to understand the code to fix what was broken. I needed to finish 
                          implementing our sentiment analysis algorithm as well as create alerts that would send emails to the correct people.
                          <br></br>
                          <br></br>
                          For IAM provisioning, I am now in charge of facilitating the provisioning of IAM roles to different app teams with their cloud applications. This involves adding their roles to our Terraform 
                          module as well as implementing the principle of least privilege. This requires strict consulting and requirements elicitation with the app teams to accurately provide the correct permissions 
                          in our production cloud environment.

                          <li>Visualized overall summary and individual IP metrics for all Windstream markets using Grafana</li>

                        time at Clemson, where the focus is on both introducing injured military veterans to adaptive sports as well as working directly with the US Paralympic Soccer Team.<br></br>
                        With the veterans, we are on our 5th year of a grant that provides us the ability to host 3-4 day camps throughout the year all over the nation that will bring in the veterans together.
                        In the camps, we have introduced adaptive sport to the veterans, gave them their grassroots soccer coaching license, and as of this year, mental health first aid certified as well.
                        I have participated myself in over 5 camps now helping out with the veterans as well as doing research throughout the camp to collect data surrounding best practices, program evaluation and impact to further improve the program's efforts. <br></br>I have also now received a Blaze Sports Adaptive Recreation and Sports Specialist as well as a Mental Health First Aid certification.  <br></br>
                        Another aspect of our program is directly help develop the US Paralympic Soccer Team in preparation for the 2028 Paralympic Games in Los Angeles.
                        We are working to start a paralympic soccer team here at Clemson, one of the first teams for a university.  We also work with the head coach of the US team to scout players throughout

                        <p>I have been a soccer referee since I was 13 years old. Since I played soccer at the time, it made sense to me to get into refereeing as well to be part of a different aspect of the game.
                          Throughout my time as a referee, I have been in charge of player safety, enforcing the Laws of the Game, travelling across the country, as well as maintain my physical fitness to keep up with the
                          ever increasing speed of play.  I've learned many life skills from being a referee from a young age such as person management, teamwork between my referee crew, as well as confidence from having to
                          stick with my decision with at least the other team and parents disagreeing with me. </p>
