                        <p>
                          Over Summer 2021, I completed my internship at Windstream Communications in the IP Engineering department under the tools
                          and automation team. I had the opportunity to work on automation that directly helped the 
                          engineers I worked with on a daily basis, as well as a leadership project in which I was able to 
                          research and start development on automation and pitch the ideas to Windstream executives. Some of the 
                          highlights from the summer include:
                          <li>Developed Python script to alert and create a JIRA ticket when a Windstream serviced market fell below an available IP threshold, eliminating the possibility of a stale market</li>
                          <li>Developed Python script to web scrape IP metrics for all Windstream markets and store in InfluxDB</li>
                          <li>Visualized overall summary and individual IP metrics for all Windstream markets using Grafana</li>
                          <li>Developed Python script to compile a list of the CIDR representation of free IP space available to be distributed to other markets</li>
                          <li>Researched and initiated automation projects that were pitched to Windstream executives to continue development on</li>

                        time at Clemson, where the focus is on both introducing injured military veterans to adaptive sports as well as working directly with the US Paralympic Soccer Team.<br></br>
                        With the veterans, we are on our 5th year of a grant that provides us the ability to host 3-4 day camps throughout the year all over the nation that will bring in the veterans together.
                        In the camps, we have introduced adaptive sport to the veterans, gave them their grassroots soccer coaching license, and as of this year, mental health first aid certified as well.
                        I have participated myself in over 5 camps now helping out with the veterans as well as doing research throughout the camp to collect data surrounding best practices, program evaluation and impact to further improve the program's efforts. <br></br>I have also now received a Blaze Sports Adaptive Recreation and Sports Specialist as well as a Mental Health First Aid certification.  <br></br>
                        Another aspect of our program is directly help develop the US Paralympic Soccer Team in preparation for the 2028 Paralympic Games in Los Angeles.
                        We are working to start a paralympic soccer team here at Clemson, one of the first teams for a university.  We also work with the head coach of the US team to scout players throughout
                        the country that could be potential candidates for both the Clemson team as well as the US team.<br></br>

                          ever increasing speed of play.  I've learned many life skills from being a referee from a young age such as person management, teamwork between my referee crew, as well as confidence from having to
                          stick with my decision with at least the other team and parents disagreeing with me. </p>
