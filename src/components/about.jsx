                    <p>I am currently a student in my last semester at Clemson University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematical Sciences. I am set to graduate in December 2021 and as of now I have a 3.63 GPA. My 2-year plan after finishing the undergraduate program at Clemson is to continue my education at graduate school focusing on either software engineering or artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>My goals to finish up the year be hired to a software engineer position, apply to Georgia Tech for graduate school, as well as working on some of my side projects. During my 3 rotations at Itron, I worked on projects that tested my abilities from hardware to embedded systems to a small portion of software development. In my most recent internship at Windstream Communcations, I was able to have a software engineering type role and I now know that is my desired career path with getting into product management at a later stage in life.  For my side projects, I've been interested in using computer vision for eye tracking, creating an Apple Music to Spotify converter, improving my 2-D game, and developing an iOS application for soccer referees or powerlifitng, along with an other project that comes to mind. </p>
                    <p>When I am not programming or doing schoolwork, I am usually found doing something active. I regularly play and referee soccer, play golf, as well as powerlift. At Clemson, I participate in both intramural soccer and the Clemson Weight Club. On the weekends, I am usually at the soccer field refereeing youth and adult games, which I have been doing for over the past 7 years.</p>
