                    <p>As of December 2021, I am a Clemson University alumnus majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematical Sciences with a final GPA of 3.65. I am now part of the Early Talent Program at Ally Financial in their Enterprise Technology division.</p>
                    <p>My goals for 2022 are to be accepted to graduate school focusing on software development or artificial intelligence while working full-time at Ally, as well as working on some of my side projects. During my 3 rotations at Itron, I worked on projects that tested my abilities from hardware to embedded systems to a small portion of software development. In my most recent internship at Windstream Communications, I was able to have a software engineering type role and I now know that is my desired career path with getting into product management at a later stage in life. For my side projects, I've been interested in using computer vision for eye tracking, creating an Apple Music to Spotify converter, improving my 2-D game, and developing an iOS application for soccer referees or powerlifting, along with another project that comes to mind.</p>
                    <p>When I am not programming or doing schoolwork, I am usually found doing something active. I regularly play and referee soccer, play golf, as well as powerlift. At Clemson, I participate in both intramural soccer and the Clemson Weight Club. On the weekends, I am usually at the soccer field refereeing youth and adult games, which I have been doing for over the past 7 years.</p>
